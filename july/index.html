            <h3 class="margin-top-10">week 1 <span class="light-grey">|</span> data</h3>

            <p>
              Starting off our collaboration with the theme <i>movies</i> as long as there was some personal connection to the data. I started with a general search of movies, to get a feeling of what might be out there. I came across budget and gross information per movie pretty quickly, found my way to the <a href="http://www.omdbapi.com/">OMDb API</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/interfaces">IMDb ftp</a>, where you can download huge files with all of the information on movies & series. Having access to such a large databases seemed like a very interesting angle to start working with, but it wasn't very personal.
            </p>

            <p>
              So, instead I started looking for data on my favorite movie (trilogy); the Lord of the Rings. I still remember, as a 12-year old girl, waiting at the movie theater more than 1.5 hours in advance with my parents to get the best spots in the theater (it was still first come, first serve back then). Collecting magazine clippings and posters and later fondly watching all of the extras (even for a second time). It's more than 9 hours of film that I can watch year after year.
            </p>

            <p>
              I found a fascinating <a href="https://github.com/jennybc/lotr">dataset</a> about the number of words spoken by each character in the extended editions of all 3 films. I did a few checks, comparing the word count to <a href="http://www.ageofthering.com/">scripts available on Age of the Ring</a> (which serendipitously / sadly seems to have expired only 2 days after I finished my data preparation) and they coincided pretty well. 
            </p>

            <p>
              In the data, there is information on the number of words spoken by each character by scene and what race that character is. However, I found <i>scenes</i> to be a bit arbitrary. They are more attached to the making of the movie, not the movie experience. So instead I went ahead and manually added an on-screen location to each of the Â±800 rows of data.
            </p>

            <p>
              Besides a map of Middle-Earth I relied heavily on the Age of the Ring scripts of the extended editions and the original scripts of the non-extended editions found on <a href="http://www.imsdb.com/">IMSDb</a>. These scripts sometimes mention the location when they talk about the scene in general. And of course, I used my own memory of watching the movies time and time again. You can find some more explanation about what I did & the dataset itself on <a href="https://github.com/nbremer/datasketches/tree/gh-pages/july/data/nadieh">the GitHub page of the dataset</a>
            </p>

            <p>
              It took a few hours, but afterwards it felt like a dataset that I had a personal connection to and wanted to visualize.
            </p>

            <h3>week 2 <span class="light-grey">|</span> sketches</h3>
			
			<p>
			  Having just bought an iPad Pro 9.7" with Apple pencil I of course wanted to try it out for my dataviz sketching. This month I used the app that most charmed me, Tayasui's Sketches II.
			</p>
            <p>
              About a month ago I got an email from Christian Wisniewski with a sketch that looked a bit like a Chord diagram but with "nodes" in the center. It seemed very intriguing and since I have a fond history of hacking the chord diagram for other purposes I wanted to try to create my own version of Christian's idea at some point. While going over ideas for the LotR data in my mind, I couldn't help but think that this dataset would fit that purpose very well. 
            </p>
			<p>
			  For my dataset, the Fellowship characters would be placed in the center. The more general locations are the arcs around it. Each character would be connected to the location where they spoke and the thickness of the chord at the location would represent the number of words spoken there. I'm not quite sure if the detailed locations should provide a more detailed level within the arcs themselves. That will probably create too many chords...
			</p>
			<a class="fancybox" href="sketches/nadieh/LotR sketch circular.jpg"> <img src="sketches/nadieh/LotR sketch circular.jpg" class="img-responsive img-month" alt="Sketch of the chord diagram line LotR idea"></a>
            
			<p>
			  I tried coming up with some other ideas, but I guess I was already sold by the chord diagram-ish one, because all of my other sketches didn't amount to anything worthwhile. There was something with a timeline; when was the scene was taking place and the number of words spoken by the character.
			</p>
			<a class="fancybox" href="sketches/nadieh/LotR sketch timeline.jpg"><img src="sketches/nadieh/LotR sketch timeline.jpg" class="img-responsive img-month" alt="Sketch of the timeline LotR idea"></a>
			<p>
			  Another one where each location would a spirograph, with the number of petals being the number of detailed locations and sized in total to the number of words spoken.

			<p>
			  Sketching on the iPad was quite fun. It was very easy to combine techniques, move things around, undo things. One minor downside was that I don't have the same amount of control over my pen in terms of drawing the longer strokes exactly as I want to. Perhaps its just a matter of getting used to the slippery surface.
		  	</p>
		  	<p>
			  But definitely going for the first sketch for next week!
