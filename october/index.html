              <h3 class="margin-top-10">week 1 <span class="light-grey">|</span> data</h3>

              <p>Because I'm going on vacation on October 15th I only have 2 weeks to complete this month (gulp). And I also have to cram a completely new 40 minute presentation in my head for the Fronteers conference that I'm speaking at on October 6th (great fun, but also time consuming). But that's not going to stop me from trying to have a lot of fun with this month's visual!</p>

              <p>We originally wanted to do something with the US elections, but with the way that turned out... So Shirley said she instead would love to look into Obama. However, as a non-American that topic didn't really interest me. However, perhaps how the Americans see/feel about the presidential family is how Europeans might feel about the royal families in Europe. So that's how we ended up with our current theme</p>

              <p>The first thing that came to mind when I thought about the royals, was their bloodlines. Due to all of that intermarriage I was sure most royals in Europe would be relatives of each other. The question was then, how close of a relative? As always I was pretty sure there would be loads of nice datasets to find about the royal bloodlines. But, as in the previous months, that turned out differently. Sure, many people had drawn some images of the closest relatives of some royals in Europe. But I really didn't want to do too much manual data gathering this month.</p>

              <p>Luckily there was <a href="http://www.daml.org/2001/01/gedcom/royal92.ged">1 file</a> that I found that seems to be <i>the</i> information source in terms of royal genealogy. However, it was made in 1992 so it is missing some of the recent additions to the royal families. I therefore manually added a few extra people to the file (which was a bit of a challenge because the file is in a strange format; a <i>gedcom</i> file), but only the current royals, their children and the children of the 1st in line (if these already exist).</p>

              <p>I did the data preparation in R as usual. Family trees are something for a network layout, so the odd format (see the screenshot below, it contained lines on individuals & families) had to be transformed into a nodes & links file that d3's force layout knows how to handle. Not too difficult, but it still required quite some lines of code to eventually be able to run through the whole file and get the info out and into some data sets.</p>
              <a class="fancybox" href="data/nadieh/royal_gedcom_file_structure.jpg"> <img src="data/nadieh/royal_gedcom_file_structure.png" class="img-responsive img-month" alt="The individuals and family section of the royal gedcom file structure"></a>

              <p>And that was all I did beforehand, just getting the node & link files in good shape. But while wrangling my way through d3's force layout I thought about new things to add or values to pre-calculate to get more insights from the structure of the network.</p>

              <p>For example, I wanted to do something with the birth year of a person, but this wasn't know for everybody. I therefore wrote a small script that tries to find a good guess; either by looking if the death date is know (and then subtracting about 60 years), or looking at the birth or death date of the spouse, children or parents, in that order (again subtracting or adding some years to account for generational differences). Not perfect, but I didn't need perfect dates for the idea that I had in mind.</p>

              <p>My final addition to the data was to calculate the smallest distance to each of the 12 current royal leaders for each person & who was the royal each person was most closely related to (and within how many steps). I wanted to have this pre-calculated so that I had access to this beforehand in the visualization. Saves a lot of calculation time :)</p>

              <p>You can read a more elaborate account of the data preparation on <a href="https://github.com/nbremer/datasketches/tree/gh-pages/october/data/nadieh">the GitHub page of the dataset</a></p>

              <h3>week 2 <span class="light-grey">|</span> sketches</h3>

              <p>I truly didn't know what kind of network the data was going to give me, so this month I actually didn't really sketch on paper, but <i>sketched with code</i> in some way I guess. Getting to know d3v4's new force functions and trying out different settings for practically all variables.</p>

              <p>Below you can see a selection of screenshots that outlines my journey through getting to know the network. I've added the time when I took the screenshot to give you an idea of how long it took to go from one step to the other.<br>My first result was a major network that blew up far beyond my humble 1000 x 1000px SVG. Increasing the gravity made a useless hairball. I eventually found some settings that seemed to reveal a bit of structure, but I needed to increase the SVGs size to 6000 x 6000px, I couldn't get it too fit into a smaller size... By now I saw that I really needed some more context to find insights, so I decided to add birth year to my data and then color the nodes by that (dark blue = long ago - yellow = recent).</p>
              <a class="fancybox" href="sketches/nadieh/network_sphere_phase.jpg"> <img src="sketches/nadieh/network_sphere_phase_small.jpg" class="img-responsive img-month" alt="Screenshots of the first sphere like phases of the network"></a>

              <p>Because birth year wasn't known for about 40% of the people in the network I first tried <i>a lot</i> of different things to somehow turn off the gravity for these nodes, so that they would be held in place through the links they had to other nodes for which the birth year was known. Like little springs. I asked around for help, looked into d3v4's underlying code of the force functions, but eventually there was no way around it. So I instead decided to estimate the birth year (as I explained in the data section above). Finally, there was some form of network that was getting slightly insightful.</p>
              <a class="fancybox" href="sketches/nadieh/network_horizontal_phase.jpg"> <img src="sketches/nadieh/network_horizontal_phase_small.jpg" class="img-responsive img-month" alt="Screenshots of the horizontal like phases of the network using birth year to pull them apart"></a>

              <p>But I still felt like it wasn't really getting anywhere. I continued again on another day and I was so depressed with the network and its potential that I didn't even take screenshots of my attempts for quite some time. Maybe I should just give up and try to use this data in a different way (or some other data, how much the royals are getting from the taxpayers money is always a hot topic).</p>

              <p>But I wanted to try one final thing to see if it turned out better, looking more at the design itself; the colors and such. The royals were most important so I made them big and noticeable. I also spread them out evenly along the vertical axis in an attempt to pull apart the network a bit more, taking into account which royals were closely connected (placing these together) and the most loosely connected on the outside.</p>

              <p>The connected nodes reminded me of constellations of stars in the sky, so I switched to a dark theme where the nodes were colored yellow and added <a href="http://www.visualcinnamon.com/2016/06/glow-filter-d3-visualization.html">a touch of glow</a>. And with the initial idea of connections between current royal leaders I calculated the distance from each node to a royal and then adjusted their opacities to depend on their closest distance to a royal. So the people closest to a royal would be very visible and this would diminish to almost completely transparent for more than 6 steps away.</p>
              <a class="fancybox" href="sketches/nadieh/network_star_phase.png"> <img src="sketches/nadieh/network_star_phase_small.jpg" class="img-responsive img-month" alt="Screenshot of the star theme with the royals made more visible"></a>

              <p>And that's when I finally started to see some potential. I decided that I had to focus on that connection to a current royal leader more and see where that would take me. The visual still needed about 2500px in width to have a nice spread of the nodes, but horizontal scrolling is not preferred, so I turned it 90 degrees so it would be a vertical scroll. To pull apart the network even more I calculated the (average) royal to which each node was closest (also explained more in the data section). I used that info to generate a slight horizontal pull of the nodes to <i>their</i> royal descendants. </p>
              <a class="fancybox" href="sketches/nadieh/network_vertical_phase.png"> <img src="sketches/nadieh/network_vertical_phase_small.png" class="img-responsive img-month" alt="Screenshots of the switch to a vertical layout and royal gravity"></a>

              <p>I wasn't really interested in the people from more than ±300 years ago, so I decided to remove everybody with an (estimated) birth date from before 1000 and I squished the vertical date scale even more towards older times to make the total visual less high.</p> 
              <a class="fancybox" href="sketches/nadieh/network_final_sketch_phase.png"> <img src="sketches/nadieh/network_final_sketch_phase_small.jpg" class="img-responsive img-month" alt="Screenshot of the final phase that finally convinced me that there was potential enough in the network"></a>

              <p>And that's when I finally ended up with a network structure that I was happy with. That I felt showed insight into how connected the current royal leaders are. Now I could go on to the next section and think about the details and interactivity to make the closest connection between people more apparent.</p>
